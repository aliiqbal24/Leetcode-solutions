### NOTES
#
# This problem can easily be solved by a for loop, by first sorting the nums array
# then we can compare the value of the ith element to i
# the default case is to return the len of the array, as this is if the the last element is missing  
# the time complexity is O(NlogN) and the space is O(1)

class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        nums.sort()

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != i:
                return i 
        return len(nums)
