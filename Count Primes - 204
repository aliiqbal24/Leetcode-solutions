###NOTES
#
# iterate from 2 to n, make that i, assume prime
# check if it is divisible by any of the primes that we have seen
# if so, it is not prime, we break that loop
# if it new, it is prime and we can add that to our seen list, and increment our totals
# once the loop is complete you have both the primes to that point, and the total
# return the total
