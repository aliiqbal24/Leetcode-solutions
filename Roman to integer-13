#### notes
# to convert from a roman numeral to an integer, we must first map each numeral to the corresponding int value with a hash map
# also we will initiallize the sum to be 0
# then we iterate through our input string, looking at both the current char and next
# first check if we are still in the string, if so continue
# since there are also subtraction in the sum, we check if current char is smaller tahn next, these are subtracted from the sum
# Otherwise, values are added for each numeral
#return the final current sum
