### NOTES
#
# start with inital zeroes for each value
# in a for loop, if any of the numbers are less than the target, then merge maxes
# at the end of the loop, if there is a solution you will have it
# because the merge operation is the only operation, its okay to rely on it
# the big O time complexity is O(N), space complexity is O(1)


class Solution:
    def mergeTriplets(self, triplets: List[List[int]], target: List[int]) -> bool:

        maxi = 0
        maxj = 0
        maxk = 0

        for a,b,c in triplets:

            if a <= target[0] and b <= target[1] and c <= target[2]:

                maxi = max(maxi, a)
                maxj = max(maxj, b)
                maxk = max(maxk, c)
