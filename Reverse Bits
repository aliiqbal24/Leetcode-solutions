### NOTES
#
# We want to reverse the binary number, then return the decimal
# what we can do is loop over all bits, checking the LSB< and if it is 1 we add  to our result
# we must add 2^(31-position) as we are returning the reverse
# after the loop we can return res, this is O(1), space, also O(1), fixed iteration
class Solution:
    def reverseBits(self, n: int) -> int:

       res = 0
       for i in range(32):
        if n & 1:
            res += 2**(31-i)
        n= n>>1
        
       return res
