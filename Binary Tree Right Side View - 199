### NOTES
#
# In this problem, we are given a tree and want to return only the nodes on the right side
# First we initialize a result array which we willl append the nodes to
# As we are only return the right side view, we want only the rightmost of each layer
# We can traverse Layer by layer, appending only the rightmost
# This is done by a bfs,where we only append the last of the level
# Finally return our result that contains the right side view

class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        
        res = []
        q = collections.deque()
        q.append(root)

        while q:

            rightside = None

            n = len(q)

            for i in range (n):
                node = q.popleft()
                if node:
                    rightside = node
                    q.append(node.left)
                    q.append(node.right)
            
            if rightside:
                res.append(rightside.val)
        return res
