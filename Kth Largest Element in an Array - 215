### NOTES
#
# In this problem we are return the kth largest element in a given array
# if we sort the array we can just return by index, but a follow up is to solve without sorting
# With that considered the next logical approach is a max heap
# we can heapify, and then pop k amount of elements, and return the kth pop
# this method has an O(N+ k Log(N)) which is usually better than the sorting approach
# there is also an O(N) space complexity due to the max heap

class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:

        maxHeap = [-n for n in nums]
        heapq.heapify(maxHeap)

        while k>1:
            heapq.heappop(maxHeap)
            k -= 1
        return -(heapq.heappop(maxHeap))
